Suppose the income of its country’s citizens   is   normally   distributed   with   a   mean   of   RM5000 and a standard   deviation   of   RM1000.The   government   is   planning   to   design   a   subsidy   policy   whereby   the   country’s   citizens   are   separated   into   three   groups   according   to   the   citizens   income,   where   Group   I   consists   of   citizens   with   the   lowest   30%   of   income,   Group   II   consists   of   citizens   with   incomes   between Groups I and III, whereas Group III consists of   citizens   with   the   highest   20%   of   income.
The following table shows the amount of   subsidy per year for   the three   groups.

The   attached   Excel   file   contains   data   on   the   weekly sales of   each of   its outlets, together with the   corresponding   average   temperature,   fuel   price, consumer price index (CPI) and unemployment rate for   that particular week.
By   selecting   one   of   the   stores   (i.e.   any   store   from    Store    1    to   45),   answer   the   following   questions. Attach the Excel output together with your   solutions.
(a)                         By   selecting   one   of the variables   (Temperature,   Fuel   Price,   CPI   or   Unemployment   Rate) as the independent variable, and Weekly   Sales as the   dependent   variable,
(i)                      form.    an   estimated   simple   linear   regression   equation   between   the    selected   independent variable and the dependent variable.   Subsequently, interpret the   slope coefficient of   the equation.

(iii)                at   the   5%   significance   level,   determine   whether   the   data   provide   sufficient   evidence that there is a positive   or negative   correlation   between   the   selected   independent variable and the dependent variable.                            (2 marks)
(b)                         By    selecting    all   the   variables    (Temperature,   Fuel   Price,   CPI   and   Unemployment   Rate) as the independent variables, and Weekly   Sales as   the   dependent   variable,(i)             form an   estimated multiple regression   equation between the independent   and   dependent   variables.    Subsequently,    interpret    the   slope   coefficients   of   the   equation.

(1 mark)(iii)       at   the    1%   significance   level,   use   the   critical   value   approach   to   test   whether   the overall multiple regression model is significant.
